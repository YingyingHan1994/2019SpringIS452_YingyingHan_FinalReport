the chia consort having concluded the perusal of the verses, and
extolled them for a time: ""after all,"" she went on to say with a smile,
""those composed by my two cousins, hs¨¹eh pao-ch'ai and lin tai-y¨¹,
differ in excellence from those of all the rest; and neither i, stupid
as i am, nor my sisters can attain their standard","""

""just simply take,"" proposed pao-ch'ai smilingly, ""the character jade in
jade-like green and change it into the character wax, that's all"," ""just see for yourself who else
besides is here!"" she smiled; ""he goes in for profuse abuses and then
maintains that it's an old story!""

""is it indeed cousin pao-y¨¹?"" pao-ch'ai remarked"," pao-y¨¹, he lost ever so many, and yet he did not distress
himself! and what remained of the cash were besides snatched away by a
few servant-girls, but all he did was to smile, that's all!""

pao-ch'ai did not allow her time to complete what she had to say, but
there and then called her to account and made her desist; whereupon chia
huan exclaimed: ""how can i compare with pao-y¨¹; you all fear him, and
keep on good terms with him, while you all look down upon me for not
being the child of my lady"," at these words, pao-y¨¹ rose, and was at once going
off when ""wait,"" shouted pao-ch'ai with a smile, ""and we'll go over
together and see her","

""if you do have the courage,"" hsiang-y¨¹n answered, ""to pick out cousin
pao-ch'ai's faults, you then may well be held to be first-rate!""

tai-y¨¹ after hearing these words, gave a sarcastic smile"," ""my dear cousin,"" she smilingly pleaded, ""do let me off this
time!""

but it just happened that pao-ch'ai, who was coming along, was at the
back of hsiang-y¨¹n, and with a face also beaming with smiles: ""i advise
you both,"" she said, ""to leave off out of respect for cousin pao-y¨¹, and
have done"," but
suddenly, she saw pao-ch'ai come in and inquire: ""where's cousin pao-y¨¹
gone?""

""do you mean to say,"" hsi jen insinuated with a sardonic smile, ""that
your cousin pao-y¨¹ has leisure to stay at home?""

when pao-ch'ai heard these words, she inwardly comprehended her meaning,
and when she further heard hsi jen remark with a sigh: ""cousins may well
be on intimate terms, but they should also observe some sort of
propriety; and they shouldn't night and day romp together; and no matter
how people may tender advice it's all like so much wind blowing past the
ears","

""how is it,"" pao-y¨¹ at once inquired, ""that cousin pao-ch'ai was
chatting along with you so lustily, and that as soon as she saw me
enter, she promptly ran away?""

hsi jen did not make any reply to his first question, and it was only
when he had repeated it that hsi jen remarked: ""do you ask me? how can i
know what goes on between you two?""

when pao-y¨¹ heard these words, and he noticed that the look on her face
was so unlike that of former days, he lost no time in putting on a smile
and asking: ""why is it that you too are angry in real earnest?""

""how could i presume to get angry!"" hsi jen rejoined smiling
indifferently; ""but you mustn't, from this day forth, put your foot into
this room! and as you have anyhow people to wait on you, you shouldn't
come again to make use of my services, for i mean to go and attend to
our old mistress, as in days of old","

""if you call this play sensational,"" pao-ch'ai smilingly expostulated,
""well then you may fitly be looked upon as being no connoisseur of
plays","

""this lad,"" lady feng observed smiling, ""is when dressed up (as a girl),
a living likeness of a certain person; did you notice it just now?""

pao-ch'ai was also aware of the fact, but she simply nodded her head
assentingly and did not say who it was"," ""the theatricals which you've seen to-day,"" she
consequently observed smiling, ""will again lead to performances for
several days, and miss pao-ch'ai will, i'm sure, give a return feast"," and when pao-ch'ai furthermore came out with a
religious disquisition, by way of illustration, and this on subjects, in
all of which he had hitherto not seen them display any ability, he
communed within himself: ""if with their knowledge, which is indeed in
advance of that of mine, they haven't, as yet, attained perception, what
need is there for me now to bring upon myself labour and vexation?""

""who has, pray,"" he hastily inquired smilingly, after arriving at the
end of his reflections, ""indulged in buddhistic mysteries? what i did
amounts to nothing more than nonsensical trash, written, at the spur of
the moment, and nothing else"
