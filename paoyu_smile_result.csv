"

pao-y¨¹, having concluded his scrutiny of her, put on a smile and said,
""this cousin i have already seen in days gone by","""

""i'll give you a style,"" suggested pao-y¨¹ smilingly; ""won't the double
style 'p'in p'in,' 'knitting brows,' do very well?""

""from what part of the standard books does that come?"" t'an ch'un
hastily interposed","

""exclusive of the four books,"" pao-y¨¹ remarked smilingly, ""the majority
of works are plagiarised; and is it only i, perchance, who plagiarise?
have you got any jade or not?"" he went on to inquire, addressing tai-y¨¹,
(to the discomfiture) of all who could not make out what he meant","""

""i've often heard people say,"" observed pao-y¨¹, ""that chin ling is of
vast extent; and how can there only be twelve maidens in it! why, at
present, in our own family alone, there are more or less several
hundreds of young girls!""

the fairy gave a faint smile"," the monitory vision
fairy promptly took pao-y¨¹'s hand in her own, and turning towards her
younger sisters, smiled and explained: ""you, and all of you, are not
aware of the why and wherefore","

to pao-y¨¹'s eager and incessant inquiries, the fairy made reply with a
sardonic smile"," lo you, who are the object of my love,
are the most lewd being under the heavens from remote ages to the
present time!""

pao-y¨¹ was quite dumbstruck by what he heard, and hastily smiling, he
said by way of reply: ""my fairy labours under a misapprehension","

""what did you dream of?"" inquired hsi jen, smiling, as she tried to
stifle her blushes, ""and whence comes all this perspiration?""

""it's a long story,"" said pao-y¨¹, ""which only a few words will not
suffice to explain"," pao-y¨¹ perhaps given you offence?""

""what an idea!"" exclaimed pao ch'ai, with a smile"," ch'in smiling; ""i'll bring him
round!""

in a short while she did in fact lead in a young lad, who, compared with
pao-y¨¹, was somewhat more slight but, from all appearances, superior to
pao-y¨¹ in eyes and eyebrows, (good looks), which were so clear and
well-defined, in white complexion and in ruddy lips, as well as graceful
appearance and pleasing manners"," as soon as they
caught sight of pao-y¨¹, they both readily drew up to him, and as they
smiled, the one put his arm round his waist, while the other grasped him
by the hand","

this remark also evoked a smile from pao-y¨¹, but without further delay
he turned a corner, went towards the north, and came into the pear
fragrance court, where, as luck would have it, he met the head manager
of the household treasury, wu hsin-teng, who, in company with the head
of the granary, tai liang, and several other head stewards, seven
persons in all, was issuing out of the account room", pao-y¨¹ at once gave a smile and pulled him up,"""

""they are not worth having,"" observed pao-y¨¹ smilingly; ""but if you do
want any, tell my young servants and it will be all right","

""with this cold weather,"" she smilingly urged, ""it's too kind of you, my
dear child, to think of coming to see me; come along on the stove-couch
at once!--bring some tea,"" she continued, addressing the servants, ""and
make it as hot as it can be!""

""isn't hs¨¹eh p'an at home?"" pao-y¨¹ having inquired: ""he's like a horse
without a halter,"" mrs","

""how are you? are you quite well again, sister?"" inquired pao-y¨¹, as he
gazed at her; whereupon pao ch'ai raised her head, and perceiving pao-y¨¹
walk in, she got up at once and replied with a smile, ""i'm all right
again; many thanks for your kindness in thinking of me","

pao ch'ai having looked at the amulet, twisted it again to the face, and
scrutinising it closely, read aloud:

  if thou wilt lose me not and never forget me,
  eternal life and constant luck will be with thee!

she perused these lines twice, and, turning round, she asked ying erh
laughingly: ""why don't you go and pour the tea? what are you standing
here like an idiot!""

""these two lines which i've heard,"" smiled ying erh, ""would appear to
pair with the two lines on your necklet, miss!""

""what!"" eagerly observed pao-y¨¹ with a grin, when he caught these words,
""are there really eight characters too on your necklet, cousin? do let
me too see it","
on the face of the locket is written:

  ""part not from me and cast me not away;""

and on the reverse:

  ""and youth, perennial freshness will display!""

pao-y¨¹ examined the charm, and having also read the inscription twice
over aloud, and then twice again to himself, he said as he smiled, ""dear
cousin, these eight characters of yours form together with mine an
antithetical verse","""

""what are these cold fragrance pills,"" remarked pao-y¨¹ smiling, ""that
they have such a fine smell? give me, cousin, a pill to try","

pao-y¨¹ and the rest lost no time in rising and offering her a seat,
whereupon pao ch'ai added with a smile, ""how can you say such things?""

""had i known sooner,"" continued tai-y¨¹, ""that he was here, i would have
kept away"," ""with a little wine,"" added pao-y¨¹ with a
smile, ""they would be first rate","""

pao-y¨¹ smilingly pleaded: ""my nurse, i'll take just one cup and no
more","""

""you have,"" interposed pao ch'ai smiling, ""the good fortune, cousin
pao-y¨¹, of having daily opportunities of acquiring a knowledge of every
kind of subject, and yet don't you know that the properties of wine are
mostly heating? if you drink wine warm, its effects soon dispel, but if
you drink it cold, it at once congeals in you; and as upon your
intestines devolves the warming of it, how can you not derive any harm?
and won't you yet from this time change this habit of yours? leave off
at once drinking that cold wine"," ""how is it,"" she smiled,
""that you listen to what she tells you, but that you treat what i say,
day after day, as so much wind blowing past your ears! how is it that
you at once do what she bids you, with even greater alacrity than you
would an imperial edict?""

when pao-y¨¹ heard this, he felt sure in his mind that tai-y¨¹ was
availing herself of this opportunity to make fun of him, but he made no
remark, merely laughing to himself and paying no further notice","

""my dear cousin,"" pao-y¨¹ said to her smilingly, ""tell me without any
prevarication which of the three characters is the best written?""

tai-y¨¹ raised her head and perceived the three characters: red, rue,
hall","""

""are you again making fun of me?"" asked pao-y¨¹ smiling; ""what about
sister hsi jen?"" he went on to inquire"," suddenly
perceiving pao-y¨¹ come in to pay his respects, and report that he was
about to go to school, chia cheng gave a sardonic smile","""

pao-y¨¹ smiled, ""dear brother,"" he added, ""don't feel aggrieved; i'll
invite you to come round to-morrow!""

""my young ancestor,"" replied li kuei, ""who presumes to look forward to
an invitation? all i entreat you is to listen to one or two words i have
to say, that's all"," upon hearing pao-y¨¹ mention that he was on his
way to school, she smiled and remarked, ""that's right! you're now going
to school and you'll be sure to reach the lunar palace and pluck the
olea fragrans; but i can't go along with you","

""how is it,"" interposed tai-y¨¹, as she once again called out to him and
stopped him, ""that you don't go and bid farewell to your cousin pao
ch'ai?""

pao-y¨¹ smiled, and saying not a word by way of reply he straightway
walked to school, accompanied by ch'in chung","

pao-y¨¹ gave a sardonic smile"," hence it
was that he felt in low spirits; but while he was plunged in solicitude
pao-y¨¹, who happened to be close by, readily inquired, ""everything may
be safely looked upon as being satisfactorily settled, and why need you,
elder brother, still be so full of concern?""

chia chen forthwith explained to him how it was that in the ladies'
apartments there was no one (to do the honours), but pao-y¨¹ at these
words smiled: ""what difficulty is there about it?"" he remarked; ""i'll
recommend some one to take temporary charge of the direction of things
for you during the month, and i can guarantee that everything will be
properly carried out","

""i've seen every one,"" rejoined chao erh; and withdrew hastily at the
conclusion of this remark, out of the apartment, while lady feng turned
towards pao-y¨¹ with a smile and said, ""your cousin lin can now live in
our house for ever","

""my dear brother,"" lady feng remarked smiling, ""you are a respectable
person, and like a girl in your ways, and shouldn't imitate those
monkeys on horseback! do get down and let both you and i sit together in
this carriage; and won't that be nice?""

at these words, pao-y¨¹ readily dismounted and climbed up into the
carriage occupied by lady feng; and they both talked and laughed, as
they continued their way"," they were up to their
pranks in the main building of the convent, when seeing chih neng come
over: ""here's neng erh,"" pao-y¨¹ exclaimed with a smile","

""why notice a creature like her?"" remarked ch'in chung; to which pao-y¨¹
rejoined laughingly: ""don't be sly! why then did you the other day, when
you were in the old lady's rooms, and there was not a soul present, hold
her in your arms? and do you want to fool me now ?""

""there was nothing of the kind,"" observed ch'in chung smiling"," chih neng could not,
though she strained every nerve, escape his importunities; nor could she
very well shout, so that she felt compelled to humour him; but while he
was in the midst of his ecstatic joy, they perceived a person walk in,
who pressed both of them down, without uttering even so much as a sound,
and plunged them both in such a fright that their very souls flew away
and their spirits wandered from their bodies; and it was after the third
party had burst out laughing with a spurting sound that they eventually
became aware that it was pao-y¨¹; when, springing to his feet
impetuously, ch'in chung exclaimed full of resentment, ""what's this that
you're up to!""

""if you get your monkey up,"" retorted pao-y¨¹, ""why, then let you and i
start bawling out;"" which so abashed chih neng that she availed herself
of the gloomy light to make her escape; while pao-y¨¹ had dragged ch'in
chung out of the room and asked, ""now then, do you still want to play
the bully!""

""my dear fellow,"" pleaded ch'in chung smilingly, ""whatever you do don't
shout out and let every one know; and all you want, i'll agree to"," as luck would have it, pao-y¨¹--for he
had been these last few days thinking of ch'in chung and so ceaselessly
sad and wounded at heart, that dowager lady chia had frequently directed
the servants to take him into the new garden to play--made his entrance
just at this very time, and suddenly became aware of the arrival of chia
chen, who said to him with a smile, ""don't you yet run away as fast as
you can? mr","

""this spot,"" observed chia cheng full of smiles, ""is indeed pleasant!
and could one, on a moonlight night, sit under the window and study, one
would not spend a whole lifetime in vain!""

as he said this, he quickly cast a glance at pao-y¨¹, and so terrified
did pao-y¨¹ feel that he hastily drooped his head","""

""if that won't do,"" the party smiled, ""well then what about the four
characters implying 'an old cottage of a man of the ch'in dynasty?'""

""this is still more exceedingly plain!"" interposed pao-y¨¹",""" saying which, she there and
then was making her way out, when pao-y¨¹ protested with a face full of
smiles: ""wherever you go, i'll follow!"" and as he, at the same time,
took the purse and began to fasten it on him, tai-y¨¹ stretched out her
hand, and snatching it away, ""you say you don't want it,"" she observed,
""and now you put it on again! i'm really much ashamed on your account!""
and these words were still on her lips when with a sound of ch'ih, she
burst out laughing",""" whereupon
the imperial consort y¨¹an, when she heard that pao-y¨¹ could compose
verses, forthwith exclaimed with a smile: ""he has in very truth made
progress!""

after chia cheng had retired out of the hall, the chia consort made it a
point to ask: ""how is it that i do not see pao-y¨¹?"" and dowager lady
chia explained: ""an outside male relative as he is, and without official
rank, he does not venture to appear before you of his own accord","

""well, if you haven't gone so far as to even ascertain her age,"" pao-y¨¹
observed, ""you're sure to know still less about other things; and it
makes it plain enough that her acquaintance with you is all vain and
futile! what a pity! what a pity!""

he then went on to enquire what her name was; and ""were i,"" continued
ming yen smiling, ""to tell you about her name it would involve a long
yarn; it's indeed a novel and strange story! she relates that while her
mother was nursing her, she dreamt a dream and obtained in this dream
possession of a piece of brocaded silk, on which were designs, in
variegated colours, representing opulence and honour, and a continuous
line of the character wan; and that this reason accounts for the name of
wan erh, which was given her","

""i felt awfully dull,"" pao-y¨¹ rejoined with a smile, ""and came to see
what you were up to","

hsi jen noticed that there were absolutely no things that he could eat,
but she felt urged to say with a smile: ""since you've come, it isn't
right that you should go empty away; and you must, whether the things be
good or bad, taste a little, so that it may look like a visit to my
house!""

as she said this, she forthwith took several seeds of the fir-cone, and
cracking off the thin skin, she placed them in a handkerchief and
presented them to pao-y¨¹","""

""gently,"" smiled hsi jen, ""for were you to let them hear, what figure
would we cut?"" and with these, words, she put out her hand and
unclasping from pao-y¨¹'s neck the jade of spiritual perception, she
faced her cousins and remarked exultingly"," secundus, into the eastern mansion, to show
ourselves before we can safely betake ourselves home; for if we don't,
people will suspect!""

hua tzu-fang, upon hearing that there was good reason in what he said,
promptly clasped pao-y¨¹ out of the chair and put him on the horse,
whereupon after pao-y¨¹ smilingly remarked: ""excuse me for the trouble
i've surely put you to,"" they forthwith entered again by the back gate;
but putting aside all details, we will now confine ourselves to pao-y¨¹","""

""don't place yourselves,"" pao-y¨¹ smiled, ""on the same footing as nurse
li, and if you were to let her alone, everything will be all right"," perceiving at the same time
that none of the party were present in the room, he put on a smile and
inquired of hsi jen: ""who were those persons dressed in red to day?""

""they're my two cousins on my mother's side,"" hsi jen explained, and
hearing this, pao-y¨¹ sang their praise as he heaved a couple of sighs"," ""i know the secret reasons
of your heart; it's i fancy because she isn't fit to wear red!""

""it isn't that,"" pao-y¨¹ protested smilingly, ""it isn't that; if such a
person as that isn't good enough to be dressed in red, who would
forsooth presume to wear it? it's because i find her so really lovely!
and if we could, after all, manage to get her into our family, how nice
it would be then!""

hsi jen gave a sardonic smile","""

""here you are again with your touchiness!"" pao-y¨¹ eagerly exclaimed
smiling, ""if i said that she should come to our house, does it
necessarily imply that she should be a servant? and wouldn't it do were
i to mention that she should come as a relative!""

""that too couldn't exalt her to be a fit match for you!"" rejoined hsi
jen; but pao-y¨¹ being loth to continue the conversation, simply busied
himself with cleaning the chestnuts","

""how is it you utter not a word?"" hsi jen laughed; ""i expect it's
because i just offended you by my inconsiderate talk! but if by and by
you have your purpose fixed on it, just spend a few ounces of silver to
purchase them with, and bring them in and have done!""

""how would you have one make any reply?"" pao-y¨¹ smilingly rejoined; ""all
i did was to extol her charms; for she's really fit to have been born in
a deep hall and spacious court as this; and it isn't for such foul
things as myself and others to contrariwise spend our days in this
place!""

""though deprived of this good fortune,"" hsi jen explained, ""she's
nevertheless also petted and indulged and the jewel of my maternal uncle
and my aunt! she's now seventeen years of age, and everything in the way
of trousseau has been got ready, and she's to get married next year"," but telling forthwith the young waiting-maids
to take the chestnuts away and eat them, she herself came and pushed
pao-y¨¹; but at the sight of pao-y¨¹ with the traces of tears on his face,
she at once put on a smiling expression and said: ""what's there in this
to wound your heart? if you positively do wish to keep me, i shall, of
course, not go away!""

pao-y¨¹ noticed that these words contained some hidden purpose, and
readily observed: ""do go on and tell me what else i can do to succeed in
keeping you here, for of my own self i find it indeed difficult to say
how!""

""of our friendliness all along,"" hsi jen smilingly rejoined, ""there's
naturally no need to speak; but, if you have this day made up your mind
to retain me here, it isn't through this friendship that you'll succeed
in doing so"," but i'll go on and mention three distinct conditions, and,
if you really do accede to my wishes, you'll then have shown an earnest
desire to keep me here, and i won't go, were even a sword to be laid on
my neck!""

""do tell me what these conditions are,"" pao-y¨¹ pressed her with
alacrity, as he smiled, ""and i'll assent to one and all","""

""well, if you do stay in here long enough,"" pao-y¨¹ remarked with a
smile, ""there's no fear as to your not having an eight-bearer-chair to
sit in!""

hsi jen gave a sardonic grin","""

pao-y¨¹ walked into the outer apartment, and having looked about him, he
returned and remarked with a smile: ""i don't want those, they may be,
for aught i know, some dirty old hag's"," ""whose nail,"" she went on
to inquire, ""has scratched this open?""

pao-y¨¹ with his body still reclining withdrew from her reach, and as he
did so, he answered with a smile: ""it isn't a scratch; it must, i
presume, be simply a drop, which bespattered my cheek when i was just
now mixing and clarifying the cosmetic paste for them","
with a snatch, pao-y¨¹ laid hold of tai-y¨¹'s sleeve meaning to see what
object was concealed in it; but tai-y¨¹ smilingly expostulated: ""at such
a time as this,"" she said, ""who keeps scents about one?""

""well, in that case,"" pao-y¨¹ rejoined with a smirking face, ""where does
this scent come from?""

""i myself don't know,"" tai-y¨¹ replied; ""i presume it must be, there's no
saying, some scent in the press which has impregnated the clothes"," ""if you still go
on teasing me,"" she shouted, ""i'll get angry with you!""

pao-y¨¹ then kept his hands off, and as he laughed, ""tell me,"" he asked,
""will you again come out with all those words or not?""

""i daren't do it again,"" tai-y¨¹ smiled and adjusted her hair; adding
with another laugh: ""i may have peculiar scents, but have you any 'warm'
scents?""

pao-y¨¹ at this question, could not for a time unfold its meaning: ""what
'warm' scent?"" he therefore asked","

""a short while back you craved for mercy,"" pao-y¨¹ observed smilingly,
""and here you are now going on talking worse than ever;"" and as he spoke
he again put out his hands","""

""as for letting you off,"" pao-y¨¹ remarked laughing, ""i'll readily let
you off, but do allow me to take your sleeve and smell it!"" and while
uttering these words, he hastily pulled the sleeve, and pressing it
against his face, kept on smelling it incessantly, whereupon tai-y¨¹ drew
her hand away and urged: ""you must be going now!""

""though you may wish me to go, i can't,"" pao-y¨¹ smiled, ""so let us now
lie down with all propriety and have a chat,"" laying himself down again,
as he spoke, while tai-y¨¹ likewise reclined, and covered her face with
her handkerchief"," ""just see for yourself who else
besides is here!"" she smiled; ""he goes in for profuse abuses and then
maintains that it's an old story!""

""is it indeed cousin pao-y¨¹?"" pao-ch'ai remarked","""

""were i,"" hsi jen smiled sardonically, ""to lose my temper over such
concerns, would i be able to stand one moment longer in this room? the
only thing is that if she goes on, day after day, doing nothing else
than clamour in this manner, how can she let people get along? but you
rashly go and hurt people's feelings for our sakes; but they'll bear it
in mind, and when they find an opportunity, they'll come out with what's
easy enough to say, but what's not pleasant to hear, and how will we all
feel then?""

while her mouth gave utterance to these words, she could not stop her
tears from running; but fearful, on the other hand, lest pao-y¨¹ should
be annoyed, she felt compelled to again strain every nerve to repress
them"," and as about this time ch'ing wen, i hsia, ch'in
wen, pi hen had all, in their desire of getting some excitement, started
in search of y¨¹an yang, hu po and their companions, to have a romp with
them, and he espied she y¨¹eh alone in the outer room, having a game of
dominoes by lamp-light, pao-y¨¹ inquired full of smiles: ""how is it you
don't go with them?""

""i've no money,"" she y¨¹eh replied","""

when pao-y¨¹ heard these words, which demonstrated distinctly that she
was another hsi jen, he consequently put on a smile and remarked: ""i'll
sit in here, so you had better set your mind at ease and go!""

""since you remain in here, there's less need for me to go,"" resumed she
y¨¹eh, ""for we two can chat and play and laugh; and won't that be nice?""

""what can we two do? it will be awfully dull! but never mind,"" pao-y¨¹
rejoined; ""this morning you said that your head itched, and now that you
have nothing to do, i may as well comb it for you"," as soon as she caught sight of them both: ""you
haven't as yet drunk from the marriage cup,"" she said with a smile full
of irony, ""and have you already put up your hair?""

""now that you've come, let me also comb yours for you,"" pao-y¨¹
continued","""

""go after your business, and have done,"" she y¨¹eh interposed laughingly;
""what's the use of your coming and asking questions of people?""

""will you also screen him?"" ch'ing wen smiled significantly; ""i know all
about your secret doings, but wait until i've got back my capital, and
we'll then talk matters over!""

with this remark still on her lips, she straightway quitted the room,
and during this while, pao-y¨¹ having finished combing her hair, asked
she y¨¹eh to quietly wait upon him, while he went to sleep, as he would
not like to disturb hsi jen"," pao-y¨¹, he lost ever so many, and yet he did not distress
himself! and what remained of the cash were besides snatched away by a
few servant-girls, but all he did was to smile, that's all!""

pao-ch'ai did not allow her time to complete what she had to say, but
there and then called her to account and made her desist; whereupon chia
huan exclaimed: ""how can i compare with pao-y¨¹; you all fear him, and
keep on good terms with him, while you all look down upon me for not
being the child of my lady"," at these words, pao-y¨¹ rose, and was at once going
off when ""wait,"" shouted pao-ch'ai with a smile, ""and we'll go over
together and see her","

""i couldn't, of course,"" pao-y¨¹ smiled, ""presume to exercise any
influence over you; but the only thing is that you are doing your own
health harm!""

""if i do ruin my health,"" tai-y¨¹ rejoined, ""and i die, it's my own
lookout! what's that to do with you?""

""what's the good,"" protested pao-y¨¹, ""of talking in this happy first
moon of dying and of living?""

""i _will_ say die,"" insisted tai-y¨¹, ""die now, at this very moment!
but you're afraid of death; and you may live a long life of a hundred
years, but what good will that be!""

""if all we do is to go on nagging in this way,"" pao-y¨¹ remarked smiling,
""will i any more be afraid to die? on the contrary, it would be better
to die, and be free!""

""quite so!"" continued tai-y¨¹ with alacrity, ""if we go on nagging in this
way, it would be better for me to die, and that you should be free of
me!""

""i speak of my own self dying,"" pao-y¨¹ added, ""so don't misunderstand my
words and accuse people wrongly"," it's distinctly very cold, to-day, and yet, how is it
that you are so contrary as to go and divest yourself of the pelisse
with the bluish breast-fur overlapping the cloth?""

""why say i didn't wear it?"" pao-y¨¹ smilingly observed"," ""my dear cousin,"" she smilingly pleaded, ""do let me off this
time!""

but it just happened that pao-ch'ai, who was coming along, was at the
back of hsiang-y¨¹n, and with a face also beaming with smiles: ""i advise
you both,"" she said, ""to leave off out of respect for cousin pao-y¨¹, and
have done","""

""one can neither tell whether it has been really lost,"" tai-y¨¹, who
stood by, interposed, smiling the while sarcastically; ""nor could one
say whether it hasn't been given away to some one to be mounted in some
trinket or other and worn!""

pao-y¨¹ made no reply; but set to work, seeing that the two sides of the
dressing table were all full of toilet boxes and other such articles,
taking up those that came under his hand and examining them"," but
suddenly, she saw pao-ch'ai come in and inquire: ""where's cousin pao-y¨¹
gone?""

""do you mean to say,"" hsi jen insinuated with a sardonic smile, ""that
your cousin pao-y¨¹ has leisure to stay at home?""

when pao-ch'ai heard these words, she inwardly comprehended her meaning,
and when she further heard hsi jen remark with a sigh: ""cousins may well
be on intimate terms, but they should also observe some sort of
propriety; and they shouldn't night and day romp together; and no matter
how people may tender advice it's all like so much wind blowing past the
ears","

""how is it,"" pao-y¨¹ at once inquired, ""that cousin pao-ch'ai was
chatting along with you so lustily, and that as soon as she saw me
enter, she promptly ran away?""

hsi jen did not make any reply to his first question, and it was only
when he had repeated it that hsi jen remarked: ""do you ask me? how can i
know what goes on between you two?""

when pao-y¨¹ heard these words, and he noticed that the look on her face
was so unlike that of former days, he lost no time in putting on a smile
and asking: ""why is it that you too are angry in real earnest?""

""how could i presume to get angry!"" hsi jen rejoined smiling
indifferently; ""but you mustn't, from this day forth, put your foot into
this room! and as you have anyhow people to wait on you, you shouldn't
come again to make use of my services, for i mean to go and attend to
our old mistress, as in days of old"," she y¨¹eh felt constrained to follow him in, but
pao-y¨¹ at once pushed her out, saying: ""i don't venture to disturb you
two;"" so that she y¨¹eh had no alternative but to leave the room with a
smiling countenance, and to bid two young waiting-maids go in","

pao-y¨¹ was so much at his wit's ends that he had no alternative but to
take her hand and smilingly ask: ""what's the matter with you, after all,
that i've had to ask you something time after time?""

hsi jen opened her eyes wide"," ""get up,"" pao-y¨¹ pressed her with a
smile, ""and come and have breakfast, for the plays will commence
shortly; but whichever plays you would like to listen to, do tell me so
that i may be able to choose them"," ""in that case,"" she rejoined, ""you had
better specially engage a troupe and select those i like sung for my
benefit; for on this occasion you can't be so impertinent as to make use
of their expense to ask me what i like!""

""what's there impossible about this?"" pao-y¨¹ answered smiling; ""well,
to-morrow i'll readily do as you wish, and ask them too to make use of
what is yours and mine","

""every thing has,"" he observed, ""a why and a wherefore; which, when
spoken out, don't even give people pain; but you will rush into a rage,
and all without any rhyme! but to what really does it owe its rise?""

""it's well enough, after all, for you to ask me,"" tai-y¨¹ rejoined with
an indifferent smile, ""but i myself don't know why! but am i here to
afford you people amusement that you will compare me to an actress, and
make the whole lot have a laugh at me?""

""i never did liken you to anything,"" pao-y¨¹ protested, ""neither did i
ever laugh at you! and why then will you get angry with me?""

""was it necessary that you should have done so much as made the
comparison,"" tai-y¨¹ urged, ""and was there any need of even any laughter
from you? why, though you mayn't have likened me to anything, or had a
laugh at my expense, you were, yea more dreadful than those who did
compare me (to a singing girl) and ridiculed me!""

pao-y¨¹ could not find anything with which to refute the argument he had
just heard, and tai-y¨¹ went on to say","""

""whether she gives a return feast or not,"" pao-y¨¹ rejoined with an
apathetic smirk, ""is no concern of mine!""

when hsi jen perceived the tone, so unlike that of other days, with
which these words were pronounced: ""what's this that you're saying?"" she
therefore remarked as she gave another smile","""

""they are all,"" hsi jen added, smilingly, ""pleasant and agreeable, and
were you also a little pleasant and agreeable, wouldn't it conduce to
the enjoyment of the whole company?""

""what about the whole company, and they and i?"" pao-y¨¹ urged","""

the three of them crossed over, in point of fact, into pao-y¨¹'s room,
and tai-y¨¹ was the first to smile and observe"," it's excellently done!""

pao-y¨¹ smiled"," but no
sooner had he reached the door of the corridor than he espied hsi jen
standing leaning against the side; who perceiving pao-y¨¹ come back safe
and sound heaped smile upon smile, and asked: ""what did he want you
for?""

""there was nothing much,"" pao-y¨¹ explained, ""he simply feared that i
would, when i get into the garden, be up to mischief, and he gave me all
sorts of advice;"" and, as while he explained matters, they came into the
presence of lady chia, he gave her a clear account, from first to last,
of what had transpired"," but when he saw that lin tai-y¨¹ was at the
moment in the room, pao-y¨¹ speedily inquired of her: ""which place do you
think best to live in?""

tai-y¨¹ had just been cogitating on this subject, so that when she
unexpectedly heard pao-y¨¹'s inquiry, she forthwith rejoined with a
smile: ""my own idea is that the hsio hsiang kuan is best; for i'm fond
of those clusters of bamboos, which hide from view the tortuous
balustrade and make the place more secluded and peaceful than any
other!""

pao-y¨¹ at these words clapped his hands and smiled","

""that's right, well done!"" pao-y¨¹ remarked smiling; ""come and sweep
these flowers, and throw them into the water yonder"," and when you shall have
by and by become the consort of an officer of the first degree, and you
shall have fallen ill from old age and returned to the west, i'll come
to your tomb and bear your stone tablet for ever on my back!""

as he uttered these words, lin tai-y¨¹ burst out laughing with a sound of
""pu ch'ih,"" and rubbing her eyes, she sneeringly remarked: ""i too can
come out with this same tune; but will you now still go on talking
nonsense? pshaw! you're, in very truth, like a spear-head, (which looks)
like silver, (but is really soft as) wax!""

""go on, go on!"" pao-y¨¹ smiled after this remark; ""and what you've said,
i too will go and tell!""

""you maintain,"" lin tai-y¨¹ rejoined sarcastically, ""that after glancing
at anything you're able to recite it; and do you mean to say that i
can't even do so much as take in ten lines with one gaze?""

pao-y¨¹ smiled and put his book away, urging: ""let's do what's right and
proper, and at once take the flowers and bury them; and don't let us
allude to these things!""

forthwith the two of them gathered the fallen blossoms; but no sooner
had they interred them properly than they espied hsi jen coming, who
went on to observe: ""where haven't i looked for you? what! have you
found your way as far as this! but our senior master, mr"," having been found, and brought back home, by hsi
jen, he discovered yuan yang reclining on the bed, in the act of
examining hsi jen's needlework; but when she perceived pao-y¨¹ arrive,
she forthwith remarked: ""where have you been? her venerable ladyship is
waiting for you to tell you to go over and pay your obeisance to our
senior master, and don't you still make haste to go and change your
clothes and be off!""

hsi jen at once walked into the room to fetch his clothes, and pao-y¨¹
sat on the edge of the bed, and pushed his shoes off with his toes; and,
while waiting for his boots to put them on, he turned round and
perceiving that y¨¹an yang, who was clad in a light red silk jacket and a
green satin waistcoat, and girdled with a white crepe sash, had her face
turned the other way, and her head lowered giving her attention to the
criticism of the needlework, while round her neck she wore a collar with
embroidery, pao-y¨¹ readily pressed his face against the nape of her
neck, and as he sniffed the perfume about it, he did not stay his hand
from stroking her neck, which in whiteness and smoothness was not below
that of hsi jen; and as he approached her, ""my dear girl,"" he said
smiling and with a drivelling face, ""do let me lick the cosmetic off
your mouth!"" clinging to her person, as he uttered these words, like
twisted sweetmeat","

""you've really improved vastly from what you were before,"" added pao-y¨¹
smiling; ""you verily look just is if you were my son!""

""how very barefaced!"" chia lien exclaimed as he burst out laughing;
""here's a person four or five years your senior to be made your son!""

""how far are you in your teens this year?"" pao-y¨¹ inquired with a smile","

this chia y¨¹n was, in real deed, sharp and quick-witted; and when he
heard pao-y¨¹ remark that he looked like his son, he readily gave a
sarcastic smile and observed, ""the proverb is true which says, 'the
grandfather is rocked in the cradle while the grandson leans on a
staff"," ""but to
acknowledge him as a son is no easy question to settle!"" and with these
words, he walked in; whereupon pao-y¨¹ smilingly said: ""to-morrow when
you have nothing to do, just come and look me up; but don't go and play
any devilish pranks with them! i've just now no leisure, so come
to-morrow, into the library, where i'll have a chat with you for a whole
day, and take you into the garden for some fun!""

with this remark still on his lips, he laid hold of the saddle and
mounted his horse; and, followed by the whole bevy of pages, he crossed
over to chia she's on this side; where having discovered that chia she
had nothing more the matter with him than a chill which he had suddenly
contracted, he commenced by delivering dowager lady chia's message, and
next paid his own obeisance"," but when pao-y¨¹ perceived
them rise, he too felt a wish to go back along with them, but madame
hsing remarked smilingly, ""you had better sit a while as i've something
more to tell you,"" so that pao-y¨¹ had no alternative but to stay"," but at the sight of them, pao-y¨¹ hastily waved his hand
and exclaimed: ""no matter, no matter; i don't want you,"" whereupon the
matrons had no help but to withdraw out of the rooms; and as pao-y¨¹
perceived that there were no waiting-maids at hand, he had to come down
and take a cup and go up to the teapot to pour the tea; when he heard
some one from behind him observe: ""master secundus, beware, you'll
scorch your hand; wait until i come to pour it!"" and as she spoke, she
walked up to him, and took the cup from his grasp, to the intense
surprise, in fact, of pao-y¨¹, who inquired: ""where were you that you
have suddenly come to give me a start?""

the waiting-maid smiled as she handed him the tea"
