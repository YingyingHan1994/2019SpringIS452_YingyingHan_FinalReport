# 2019SpringIS452_YingyingHan_FinalReport
This is a repository storing and presenting the codes for Yingying Han for her final project in IS452 (2019Spring)
I will have two code files named "yh17_Chinesefile.py" and "yh17_Englishfile.py".
I will upload the English stop words file (stopwords.txt) and Chinese stop word file (Chinese_Stopwords.txt) also. 
Run the codes seperately, you can see three numbers in the shell, representing how many time "paoyü", tai-yü", and "paochia" smile.
Run the codes and you will also see the exported data: the extracted sentences proving each person smiles.
