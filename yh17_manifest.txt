Two original raw data files:
(1) EnglishVer_BookI.txt
(2) ChineseVer_UTF8.txt

Two codes files with code comments:
(1) yh17_Chinesefile.py
(2) yh17_Englishfile.py

One code file with comments:
(1) yh17_English_preprocessing.py

This file stores some pre-processing codes with some preprocessing steps, which are proved not necessary for data analysis later.
So, I just stored these codes in this file.

Six exported data files:
(1)paochia_smile_result.csv
(2)paoyu_smile_result.csv
(3)taiyu_smile_result.csv
(4)chinese_paochia_smile_result.csv
(5)chinese_paoyu_smile_result.csv
(6)chinese_taiyu_smile_result.csv

Two stopwords files:
(1) stopwords.txt
(2) Chinese_Stopwords

One narrative file:
(1) yh17_finalproject_narratives.pdf
