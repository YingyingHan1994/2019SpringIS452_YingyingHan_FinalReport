"""

y¨¹-ts'un clapped his hands and said smiling, ""it's so, i know! for this
female pupil of mine, whose name is tai-y¨¹, invariably pronounces the
character _min_ as _mi_, whenever she comes across it in the
course of her reading; while, in writing, when she comes to the
character 'min,' she likewise reduces the strokes by one, sometimes by
two","

tai-y¨¹ lost no time in returning her smile and saluting her with all
propriety, addressing her as my sister-in-law","

the tea and fruit had by this time been cleared, and dowager lady chia
directed two old nurses to take tai-y¨¹ to go and see her two maternal
uncles; whereupon chia she's wife, madame hsing, hastily stood up and
with a smiling face suggested, ""i'll take my niece over; for it will
after all be considerably better if i go!""

""quite so!"" answered dowager lady chia, smiling; ""you can go home too,
and there will be no need for you to come over again!""

madame hsing expressed her assent, and forthwith led tai-y¨¹ to take
leave of madame wang"," after a while,
she said goodbye, and though madame hsing used every argument to induce
her to stay for the repast and then leave, tai-y¨¹ smiled and said, ""i
shouldn't under ordinary circumstances refuse the invitation to dinner,
which you, aunt, in your love kindly extend to me, but i have still to
cross over and pay my respects to my maternal uncle secundus; if i went
too late, it would, i fear, be a lack of respect on my part; but i shall
accept on another occasion","

""these are your cousin feng's rooms,"" explained madame wang to tai-y¨¹,
as she pointed to them smiling","

""exclusive of the four books,"" pao-y¨¹ remarked smilingly, ""the majority
of works are plagiarised; and is it only i, perchance, who plagiarise?
have you got any jade or not?"" he went on to inquire, addressing tai-y¨¹,
(to the discomfiture) of all who could not make out what he meant","

""how is it, miss,"" she inquired smiling, ""that you have not turned in as
yet?""

tai-y¨¹ at once put on a smile","""

tai-y¨¹ forced a smile","

pao-y¨¹ and the rest lost no time in rising and offering her a seat,
whereupon pao ch'ai added with a smile, ""how can you say such things?""

""had i known sooner,"" continued tai-y¨¹, ""that he was here, i would have
kept away","

""if one comes,"" tai-y¨¹ urged smiling, ""then all come, and when one
doesn't come, then no one comes","

tai-y¨¹ was bent upon cracking melon seeds, saying nothing but simply
pursing up her lips and smiling, when, strange coincidence, hs¨¹eh yen,
tai-y¨¹'s waiting-maid, walked in and handed her mistress a small
hand-stove"," ""how is it,"" she smiled,
""that you listen to what she tells you, but that you treat what i say,
day after day, as so much wind blowing past your ears! how is it that
you at once do what she bids you, with even greater alacrity than you
would an imperial edict?""

when pao-y¨¹ heard this, he felt sure in his mind that tai-y¨¹ was
availing herself of this opportunity to make fun of him, but he made no
remark, merely laughing to himself and paying no further notice","

""you've always been delicate and unable to stand the cold,"" interposed
""aunt"" hs¨¹eh, ""and is it not a kind attention on their part to have
thought of you?""

""you don't know, aunt, how it really stands,"" responded tai-y¨¹
smilingly; ""fortunately enough, it was sent to me here at your quarters;
for had it been in any one else's house, wouldn't it have been a slight
upon them? is it forsooth nice to think that people haven't so much as a
hand-stove, and that one has fussily to be sent over from home? people
won't say that the waiting-maids are too officious, but will imagine
that i'm in the habit of behaving in this offensive fashion","""

""why should i urge him on?"" rejoined lin tai-y¨¹, with a sarcastic smile,
""nor will i trouble myself to give him advice","
""really,"" she observed, ""every remark this girl lin utters is sharper
than a razor! i didn't say anything much!""

pao ch'ai too could not suppress a smile, and as she pinched tai-y¨¹'s
cheek, she exclaimed, ""oh the tongue of this frowning girl! one can
neither resent what it says, nor yet listen to it with any
gratification!""

""don't be afraid!"" mrs","

""my dear cousin,"" pao-y¨¹ said to her smilingly, ""tell me without any
prevarication which of the three characters is the best written?""

tai-y¨¹ raised her head and perceived the three characters: red, rue,
hall","

""how is it,"" interposed tai-y¨¹, as she once again called out to him and
stopped him, ""that you don't go and bid farewell to your cousin pao
ch'ai?""

pao-y¨¹ smiled, and saying not a word by way of reply he straightway
walked to school, accompanied by ch'in chung"," but not a long interval
elapsed before hsi jen came to serve the tea; and when she perceived
that on his person not one of the ornaments remained, she consequently
smiled and inquired: ""have all the things that you had on you been again
taken away by these barefaced rascals?""

as soon as lin tai-y¨¹ heard this remark, she crossed over to him and saw
at a glance that not one single trinket was, in fact, left","

""my dear cousin,"" he smilingly pleaded, ""do spare it!"" and as tai-y¨¹
dashed down the scissors and wiped her tears: ""you needn't,"" she urged,
""be kind to me at one moment, and unkind at another; if you wish to have
a tiff, why then let's part company!"" but as she spoke, she lost control
over her temper, and, jumping on her bed, she lay with her face turned
towards the inside, and set to work drying her eyes",""" saying which, she there and
then was making her way out, when pao-y¨¹ protested with a face full of
smiles: ""wherever you go, i'll follow!"" and as he, at the same time,
took the purse and began to fasten it on him, tai-y¨¹ stretched out her
hand, and snatching it away, ""you say you don't want it,"" she observed,
""and now you put it on again! i'm really much ashamed on your account!""
and these words were still on her lips when with a sound of ch'ih, she
burst out laughing","

the chia consort having concluded the perusal of the verses, and
extolled them for a time: ""after all,"" she went on to say with a smile,
""those composed by my two cousins, hs¨¹eh pao-ch'ai and lin tai-y¨¹,
differ in excellence from those of all the rest; and neither i, stupid
as i am, nor my sisters can attain their standard","
with a snatch, pao-y¨¹ laid hold of tai-y¨¹'s sleeve meaning to see what
object was concealed in it; but tai-y¨¹ smilingly expostulated: ""at such
a time as this,"" she said, ""who keeps scents about one?""

""well, in that case,"" pao-y¨¹ rejoined with a smirking face, ""where does
this scent come from?""

""i myself don't know,"" tai-y¨¹ replied; ""i presume it must be, there's no
saying, some scent in the press which has impregnated the clothes"," ""if you still go
on teasing me,"" she shouted, ""i'll get angry with you!""

pao-y¨¹ then kept his hands off, and as he laughed, ""tell me,"" he asked,
""will you again come out with all those words or not?""

""i daren't do it again,"" tai-y¨¹ smiled and adjusted her hair; adding
with another laugh: ""i may have peculiar scents, but have you any 'warm'
scents?""

pao-y¨¹ at this question, could not for a time unfold its meaning: ""what
'warm' scent?"" he therefore asked","

tai-y¨¹ nodded her head and smiled deridingly","""

""as for letting you off,"" pao-y¨¹ remarked laughing, ""i'll readily let
you off, but do allow me to take your sleeve and smell it!"" and while
uttering these words, he hastily pulled the sleeve, and pressing it
against his face, kept on smelling it incessantly, whereupon tai-y¨¹ drew
her hand away and urged: ""you must be going now!""

""though you may wish me to go, i can't,"" pao-y¨¹ smiled, ""so let us now
lie down with all propriety and have a chat,"" laying himself down again,
as he spoke, while tai-y¨¹ likewise reclined, and covered her face with
her handkerchief","""

""you freely indulge in abusing people,"" tai-y¨¹ added with a smile, ""and
then go on to say that it's an old story"," but suddenly they heard
clamouring begin in his room, and after they had all lent an ear and
listened, lin tai-y¨¹ was the first to smile and make a remark","

tai-y¨¹ gave a sardonic smile","

""i couldn't, of course,"" pao-y¨¹ smiled, ""presume to exercise any
influence over you; but the only thing is that you are doing your own
health harm!""

""if i do ruin my health,"" tai-y¨¹ rejoined, ""and i die, it's my own
lookout! what's that to do with you?""

""what's the good,"" protested pao-y¨¹, ""of talking in this happy first
moon of dying and of living?""

""i _will_ say die,"" insisted tai-y¨¹, ""die now, at this very moment!
but you're afraid of death; and you may live a long life of a hundred
years, but what good will that be!""

""if all we do is to go on nagging in this way,"" pao-y¨¹ remarked smiling,
""will i any more be afraid to die? on the contrary, it would be better
to die, and be free!""

""quite so!"" continued tai-y¨¹ with alacrity, ""if we go on nagging in this
way, it would be better for me to die, and that you should be free of
me!""

""i speak of my own self dying,"" pao-y¨¹ added, ""so don't misunderstand my
words and accuse people wrongly"," ""you'll by and by catch a cold,"" she remarked,
""and then you'll again have to starve, and vociferate for something to
eat!""

while these two were having this colloquy, hsiang-y¨¹n was seen to walk
in! ""you two, ai cousin and cousin lin,"" she ventured jokingly, ""are
together playing every day, and though i've managed to come after ever
so much trouble, you pay no heed to me at all!""

""it's invariably the rule,"" tai-y¨¹ retorted smilingly, ""that those who
have a defect in their speech will insist upon talking; she can't even
come out correctly with 'erh' (secundus) cousin, and keeps on calling
him 'ai' cousin, 'ai' cousin! and by and by when you play 'wei ch'i'
you're sure also to shout out yao, ai, (instead of erh), san; (one, two,
three)","

""if you do have the courage,"" hsiang-y¨¹n answered, ""to pick out cousin
pao-ch'ai's faults, you then may well be held to be first-rate!""

tai-y¨¹ after hearing these words, gave a sarcastic smile","""

""one can neither tell whether it has been really lost,"" tai-y¨¹, who
stood by, interposed, smiling the while sarcastically; ""nor could one
say whether it hasn't been given away to some one to be mounted in some
trinket or other and worn!""

pao-y¨¹ made no reply; but set to work, seeing that the two sides of the
dressing table were all full of toilet boxes and other such articles,
taking up those that came under his hand and examining them","""

tai-y¨¹ smiled sarcastically","

""every thing has,"" he observed, ""a why and a wherefore; which, when
spoken out, don't even give people pain; but you will rush into a rage,
and all without any rhyme! but to what really does it owe its rise?""

""it's well enough, after all, for you to ask me,"" tai-y¨¹ rejoined with
an indifferent smile, ""but i myself don't know why! but am i here to
afford you people amusement that you will compare me to an actress, and
make the whole lot have a laugh at me?""

""i never did liken you to anything,"" pao-y¨¹ protested, ""neither did i
ever laugh at you! and why then will you get angry with me?""

""was it necessary that you should have done so much as made the
comparison,"" tai-y¨¹ urged, ""and was there any need of even any laughter
from you? why, though you mayn't have likened me to anything, or had a
laugh at my expense, you were, yea more dreadful than those who did
compare me (to a singing girl) and ridiculed me!""

pao-y¨¹ could not find anything with which to refute the argument he had
just heard, and tai-y¨¹ went on to say","

at these words, tai-y¨¹ felt inclined to betake herself back at once; but
hsi jen smiled and said: ""please stop, miss","""

the three of them crossed over, in point of fact, into pao-y¨¹'s room,
and tai-y¨¹ was the first to smile and observe","

""quite so!"" replied ying ch'un smiling; after which they also conned the
one below, by t'an-ch'un, which ran thus and had something to do with an
object:

  this is the time when 'neath the stairs the pages their heads raise!
  the term of ""pure brightness"" is the meetest time this thing to make!
  the vagrant silk it snaps, and slack, without tension it strays!
  the east wind don't begrudge because its farewell it did take!

""it would seem,"" chia cheng suggested, ""as if that must be a kite!""

""it is,"" answered t'an c'h'un; whereupon chia cheng read the one below,
which was written by tai-y¨¹ to this effect and bore upon some thing:

  after the audience, his two sleeves who brings with fumes replete?
  both by the lute and in the quilt, it lacks luck to abide!
  the dawn it marks; reports from cock and man renders effete!
  at midnight, maids no trouble have a new one to provide!
  the head, it glows during the day, as well as in the night!
  its heart, it burns from day to day and 'gain from year to year!
  time swiftly flies and mete it is that we should hold it dear!
  changes might come, but it defies wind, rain, days dark or bright!

""isn't this a scented stick to show the watch?"" chia cheng inquired"," but when he saw that lin tai-y¨¹ was at the
moment in the room, pao-y¨¹ speedily inquired of her: ""which place do you
think best to live in?""

tai-y¨¹ had just been cogitating on this subject, so that when she
unexpectedly heard pao-y¨¹'s inquiry, she forthwith rejoined with a
smile: ""my own idea is that the hsio hsiang kuan is best; for i'm fond
of those clusters of bamboos, which hide from view the tortuous
balustrade and make the place more secluded and peaceful than any
other!""

pao-y¨¹ at these words clapped his hands and smiled","
""wait!"" he smiled, ""until i put down my book, and i'll help you to clear
them up!""

""what's the book?"" tai-y¨¹ inquired"," and when you shall have
by and by become the consort of an officer of the first degree, and you
shall have fallen ill from old age and returned to the west, i'll come
to your tomb and bear your stone tablet for ever on my back!""

as he uttered these words, lin tai-y¨¹ burst out laughing with a sound of
""pu ch'ih,"" and rubbing her eyes, she sneeringly remarked: ""i too can
come out with this same tune; but will you now still go on talking
nonsense? pshaw! you're, in very truth, like a spear-head, (which looks)
like silver, (but is really soft as) wax!""

""go on, go on!"" pao-y¨¹ smiled after this remark; ""and what you've said,
i too will go and tell!""

""you maintain,"" lin tai-y¨¹ rejoined sarcastically, ""that after glancing
at anything you're able to recite it; and do you mean to say that i
can't even do so much as take in ten lines with one gaze?""

pao-y¨¹ smiled and put his book away, urging: ""let's do what's right and
proper, and at once take the flowers and bury them; and don't let us
allude to these things!""

forthwith the two of them gathered the fallen blossoms; but no sooner
had they interred them properly than they espied hsi jen coming, who
went on to observe: ""where haven't i looked for you? what! have you
found your way as far as this! but our senior master, mr"
